                    As a contractor for Pinnacle Group at Apple, I worked as a backend Javascript developer and Vue framework frontend developer. I was responsible for updating existing projects and developing new projects for internal use at Apple. In my backend development work, I created scalable and efficient solutions, and in my frontend development work, I created dynamic and user-friendly interfaces that aligned with Apple's brand. Through my experience, I developed a deep understanding of the importance of collaboration and communication in software development, and I am excited to leverage my skills and experience to contribute value to future projects.

                    During my time at Farmhand Automation, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project that involved developing a client-facing React Native application with Bluetooth connection to a robotic rover. This application allowed for control, reporting, and mapping of the rover's activities. As part of my role, I handled the creation of a WebSocket messaging manager that was used to create a connection between the application and the rover. This manager was critical to ensuring that the application could communicate effectively with the rover and provide real-time updates on its status. Through this project, I developed a deep understanding of the challenges involved in developing complex software solutions and the importance of collaboration and communication in achieving success.

                    As a developer at Tyler Technologies, I was responsible for maintaining and supporting C# 4.6 Framework applications for internal use. This involved working closely with the development team to troubleshoot issues, identify areas for improvement, and develop solutions to optimize application performance. In addition to maintaining existing applications, I was also responsible for creating and supporting CI builds in Team City and Azure DevOps. To enhance our DevOps processes, I wrote PowerShell scripts that streamlined user identification in LDAP environments. Through my work at Tyler Technologies, I gained valuable experience in maintaining and supporting complex software systems and learned how to work efficiently in a team environment to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of end-users.
